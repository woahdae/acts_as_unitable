ActsAsUnitable
==============

Makes having attributes with units easy. Rewrites one or multiple attribute setters to also set '<attribute>_unit' attribute, and getters will then re-attach that unit.

Example
=======

The tests are probably the best examples, here's the gist:

    require 'units/active_record'
    
    class Item < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_unitable :quantity
    end
    
    Item.create!(:quantity => "5 pounds")
    Item.first.quantity.unit # => 'pounds'
